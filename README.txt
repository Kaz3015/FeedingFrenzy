You are a fish in a pond and have to move around and try to eat other fish smaller than you to
win the game! But watch out: if a fish bigger than you eats you, you will lose a life. You have
3 lives total and once you lose all of them, you lose the game. If you become the biggest fish
in the pond, you win! You can move around by pressing the arrow keys. Eating a bright magenta
fish will double your max speed and eating a blue fish will double your fish's size by radius.
The bigger the fish you eat, the more your score will increase by. Your fish will accelerate
based off of your size and will have inertia based on size once you let go of the arrow key.
The rate at which your fish slows down is also based off of size. The maximum speed is 8 pixels
every time the button is pressed.
